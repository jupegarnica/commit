# Commit

## Requirements

This script requires Deno to run. If you don't have Deno installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Deno website](https://deno.land/).

You will also need an OpenAI API key to use this script. You can sign up for an account and get an API key on the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).

# Install

```sh
deno install --global -A -fn commit  jsr:@garn/commit
```

## Usage

```sh
commit [OPTIONS]
```

- `--add`: Runs `git add .` before creating the commit message.
- `--push`: Runs `git push` after creating the commit.
- `--skipEdit`: Skips the editing of the commit message before creating the commit.
- `--noCommit`: Skips the creation of the commit. Just prints the commit message.
- `--model <model>`: Specifies the model to use for generating the commit message. The default is `gpt-4o`.
- `--config`: Ask for the OpenAI API key and save it.
- `--apiKey <apiKey>`: Specifies the OpenAI API key to use. This will override the value set in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `--baseURL <baseURL>`: Specifies the base URL to use for the OpenAI API. This will override the default base URL.
- `--debug`: Enables debug mode, which will print additional information to the console.
- `--maxWords <maxWords>`: Specifies the maximum number of words to call the api. The default is 6000. Is useful to no incur in extra charges.
- `--ollama`: Uses the `llama3` model and sets the base URL to 'http://localhost:11434/v1'.
- `--help`: Prints the help message.

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key. This is required to interact with the OpenAI API.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can use `commit`:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here commit --add --push
```

This will add all changes, create a commit with a message generated by the OpenAI API, and push the changes to the current branch.
